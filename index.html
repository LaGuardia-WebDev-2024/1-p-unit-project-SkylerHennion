    <h2>An Overview of Pickles</h2>

    <p style="color:darkolivegreen; font-family: courier new">
      
         Let us begin with discussing <i>why pickles are the best</i>. They are
      sour. They are crunchy. They work well in burgers. They can be eaten so
      many different ways. Whole. Chips. Spears. Diced. Salad. They can be eaten
      in any occasion. It doesn't just stop at cucumbers. There are pickled
      beets and pickled mushrooms and the list goes on. <br /><br />
      This does not mean that all pickles are equally delectable. Some are
      actually quite horrendous. Here you will learn which pickles to
      <strong>fiend for</strong> and which to
      <strong>keep at least ten feet away from</strong>.
